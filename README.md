# GeoRacer

A web-based game, works around google streetview to make a multiplayer game, allowing users to find objectives and compete against each other for the most points

# Things to do

- Finding of the objectives
- Dynamic random spawn locations
- Dynamic objectives based on spawn location
- Display users in streetview more clearly
  - Add labels to their names
  - Add user colours to easily distinguish other people
- Implement the rest of the minimap

# Main Challenges

- Very little support for name tags on markers, initially tried a library called markers with labels, which was bugged (looking for new solution)
- Had an issue with google maps locations becoming outdated, need to think how to account for this in the future
